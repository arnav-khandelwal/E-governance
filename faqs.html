<b>Q.</b>What is Biometric Data and which are the different biometric data being used for the identification and verification of individuals in e-governance?<br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b> Biometric data is the data representing a biometric characteristic. For Example, Image data, behavioural data, sensor data, etc.
The Indian Government proposes to use biometric data for identification and verification of individuals in e-Governance applications. The biometric data includes fingerprint image, minutiae, face image and iris data.</p>

<p><b>Q.</b>How do I get a Digital Signature Certificate?<br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b>The Office of Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), issues Certificate only to Certifying Authorities. The CAs in turn issue Digital Signature Certificates to the end-users. You can approach any of the CAs for getting the Digital Signature Certificate</p>

<p><b>Q.</b>How the metadata of generic data elements will be maintained?<br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b> Each of the domains will create and maintain its own domain repository of its standardized data elements along with their metadata. A Central Metadata Registry (MDR) will be created which will maintain the standardized generic data elements (along with their metadata) common across domains. This MDR will provide the indexing/linking to different domain repositories.br>
Passion instead comes through as taking what you like to the next level instead of degrading their existence. </p>

<p><b>Q.</b>How does Authorisation differ from Authentication?br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b>Authorisation is the process of verifying that a known person has the permissions and rights to perform a certain operation in an application. Authentication, therefore, must precede authorisation.

An effective access management system incorporates one or more methods of authentication to verify the identity of the user, including passwords, digital certificates, hardware or software tokens, and biometrics. Authorisation governs what a user can access or do within an application.

<p><b>Q.</b> Why do we need e-Gov Standards?<br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b>e-Gov Standards may ensure sharing of information and seamless interoperability of data across e-Governance applications. This may also help in designing a system which can interoperate efficiently and effectively with other systems from all stake-holders of e-Governance for better decision-making, cooperation and coordination among the stake-holders of e-Governance projects.</p>
