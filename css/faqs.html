<b>Q.</b> We often hear about the bad psychological effects of games and how some people have done insane things just to play 
these games. What are the reasons for such behaviour and how can it be prevented?<br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b> Yes these games do have some psychological effects as they create an infinitely repeatable game environment that one 
could easily get addicted to and be willing to do anything just to play these games.<b>
This kind of addiction can like any other addiction like that of alcohol and cigarettes can be prevented or stopped by 
limited play time and spreading awareness of these bad effects to parents.</p>

<p><b>Q.</b> Is banning these games the right option to stop video game addiction?<br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b> No banning them right up is not necessarily the right option as people have made couriers out of these games and 
banning them outright would be like taking away their job just because a lot of people are not self-aware about these 
games addictive effects. We are not at the stage yet where these games are an incurable disease; these effects can easily 
be stopped if the parents are aware to not let their kids play for hours.</p>

<p><b>Q.</b> Would you call pro gamers addicted to the game?<br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b> Absolutely not, these people are not addicted to the games instead they play these games because it is their 
livelihood and their passion. There is a clear line of difference between addiction and passion; people addicted to a 
game don't have the passion to play the game.<br>
Passion instead comes through as taking what you like to the next level instead of degrading their existence. </p>

<p><b>Q.</b> Can these games be classified as sports? If yes, what is stopping them from becoming a part of, say, 
the Olympics?<br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b> Well yes and no, though these games stand up to the parameters that is needed to be had by a game to be called a 
sport like fair competition, people have again and again neglected the idea of them becoming sports and have been unheard 
the call of the community many times.<br>
In terms of big events like the Olympics, games don't necessarily need to be in these big sporting events as they have 
already got events of their own, from small scale charity tournaments to big tournaments scale international championships
like evolution and the international with prices going to a upwards of 10 million dollars.</p>

<p><b>Q.</b> Could these games actually help in studying human behaviour? If so, how?<br>
</font>
<font size="5" color="orange">
<b>ANS.</b> Yes they can, apart from the obvious addiction researches, they also help to study emotions because these games put 
you in control and players get more immersed in them as compared to movies and books. Apart from that, there have been 
studies using these kinds of games to study human reflexes by taking the difference of what is the stimulus of a new 
player to these kinds of games what is of the veterans. Not only these games but all kinds of games can help 
psychologists understand more about a person depending on what kinds of games they play. For example- If someone plays a 
fighting game; they are the ones, who like fair challenges, If someone likes a RPG then they like good storytelling and 
a systematic slow paced game.</p>
